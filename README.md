# Project-Visual-Data-Analysis

In this repository, I explore four different data: life expectancy, continents, population, and total fertility. In this project, I visually analyse the Gapminder Dataset and eventually create an animated scatterplot. In addition, to better understand the data themselves, I deployed Descriptive Statistical analysis tools on the datasets in separate projects.
